# PyDCAM

This library is a pybind11 based wrapper of the DCAM SDK/API.

> **This library currently only supported on Linux systems!**
> Windows support would likely be trivial to implement.

## Installation

1. First, install the DCAM driver. I believe this is only a set of udev rules.
2. Next, install the package using pip.
